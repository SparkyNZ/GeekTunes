V1.0 Submitted to app store

27/09/2013
==========
Fixed delete all hates issue - was deleting XM files in playlists and holes were filling up with .SID tunes .. NOT!

29/09/2013
==========
-Fixed delete all hates properly - deletion of tune was causing all tunes of library index higher than deleted tune to move down an index within
 the library. All playlists needed to be altered so that any tunes in the playlist of index higher than the one being deleted are decremented to
 take the 'hole' into account.
-Added: Tap track/album/artist labels to show big fading status screen (easier to read if missed at start of tune)

30/09/2013
==========
-Started adding scrollable Artist-Album-Tune heading in Easy Drill View.

01/10/2013
==========
-Completed Artist-Album-Tune scrollable heading.

04/10/2013
==========
-iTunes Store rejected v1.0 because of text on big buttons.

05/10/2013
==========
-Drew new icons for buttons.

06/10/2013
==========
-Added new icons.
-Added Type/Order button behaviour instead of Mode/Snap.

07/10/2013
==========
-Fixed issues with Order/Type buttons.
-Fixed (?) issue with MP3 playback skipping tracks (iPod chooses next after player has chosen next).. I think!
-Added green/red button background for Play/Stop.
-Backspace icon sometimes disappears - cannot figure out why.

GeekTunes: TODO
===============


v1.1 Release
-Landscape mode
-Optimise for iPhone 5 display


-Dol Ammad appears after rebuild !!
-Lha decompress maybe use 7z from Modizer


-Fader time config

-Slideable (configurable) main screen buttons

-Add smarts so that if MP3 library is changed, SIDs and MODs don't need to be rebuilt again as they take ages (ClearAllVectors() not required etc)
-Need rebuild feedback - even in background can't tell whats happening.. maybe add status bar at bottom?? Scroll messages?
-Bug: Remote events not picked up until Next or Prev pressed

Audio Player TODO:
- MED support
- Modizer libmodplug instead of MikMod (perhaps configurable)
- GT support
- Mono feature for 1 of the 4 voices in an old MOD (cycle none-1-2-3-4-none) - call this MOD Channel monotising (plus save state?)

Use Modizers libmodplug instead of mikmod


-HVSC should be imported in background for sure
-Added some XM.ZIP files.. Artist "Dol Ammad" was where they were field. Should be "Unknown"

-Can I implement SID import (ZIP interrogation) any faster??
-Detect if more library tunes have been added via iTunes
-No totals for tunes in various lists (some sort of stats needed?)
-Import of tunes in background? (Takes ages!)

-Add tristate (PAUSE) behaviour to STOP/PLAY button? (Split PLAY and CONT over button???)
- MP3 and MOD random selection?

- SID info (offline import?) - tried new Vector import method with author lists etc. STILL too slow.. maybe need to background task this or something?
- FTP server goes into sleep mode when locked.. not helpful!

- ModArchive support (artist info)
- True MED player support (RBF contacted)
- Voice recognition
-Doesn't handle two albums with same name from 2 different artists


NOTES
Modes only appear if tunes exist in library that belong to mode (Shel's phone won't display MOD/SID etc)
Now have fading info
-Use MDA5 with tune name and artist for likes - likes can then be preserved during import or changing of tune content
-Will maintain hash likes (LIKE/HATE) sensitive. Import of library will look for these and add to likes and playlists if MD5 found in MD5 like list or MD5 playlist mirrors.
-Need to remove from MD5 playlists when removed from normal playlists too. Need "ReturnHashForTuneLibIndex()"
Auto rebuild if MP3 count changes
